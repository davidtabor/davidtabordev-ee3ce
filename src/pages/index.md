    content: >-
      My development philosophy is based on client-empathy and an understanding
      of how the sites I develop best meet client needs - not just accomplish
      code on page. 


      My experience includes developing custom client API's, WordPress sites,
      CraftCMS sites, and going forward - lightning fast JAMstack static sites!
      I'm happy to work with you for one-off projects or on a long-term retainer
      basis.
