A recruitment firm in Atlanta GA requested a new site that could feature their available consultants in an e-commerce style. Through this site their higher-education clients are able to 'shop' for consultants and automate the inital contract negotiation process. 

The custom search page allows for fine-grained results filtering and shows off easy-to read context clue gems on each search result.

Each consultant has the option to autonomously upload their own content to the site though it is always vetted by the firm before final publishing.
