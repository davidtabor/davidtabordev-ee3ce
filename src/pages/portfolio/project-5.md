SC ENT needed a site that could represent and explain the specialized services offered, while still being easy to navigate and present useful location info to the end-user. This site took full advantage of CraftCMS's customizable content-modeling features to represent the providers who rotate through different branches and provide differing services.

Though this site presents a bare-bones design befitting of a doctor's office, it still provides extremely useful information and funnels end-users into contacting the nearest or most-relevant office location

I was responsible for 95% of the front-end implementation and content-modeling.
