The National Center for Life & Liberty needed a site that could accomplish three main goals: 1. Present their mission 2. Document and arrange speaking engagements 3. Sell physical and downloadable products.

This site includes informational pages, scheduling andd availability pages, and an online store that collect orders for physical items (which are handed off to a separate fulfillment team) and can also distribute downloadable pamphlets and digital media.

I was responsible for 95% of the front-end implementation and content-modeling.
