GHC needed a new site to replace an aging and cobbled-together WordPress site. This from-scratch, beautiful new site accomplished client needs by being highly-functional and easy for the client to modify on their own.

The [multiple convention pages](https://https://greathomeschoolconventions.com/locations/south-carolina) are fully customizeable by the client and feature a custom branding CSS implementation. Each convention can set a branding color via HEX value and the site will generate all of the necessary CSS classes upon publishing. This automates the creation of new convention locations and allows for higher client independence. This feature was integral during development and has already proven useful as the client added a 'Virtual Conference' due to COVID-19.

I was responsible for 85% of the front-end implementation, extensive plugin compatibility,  and content-modeling.
