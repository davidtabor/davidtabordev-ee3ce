This site for R1 Fundraising made extensive use of CraftCMS's custom content structuring. The complex data and tie-ins all over the site required strong content-modeling before the final product could be realized. 

This site pushed the limits in terms of lightweight CSS-only front-end design. Performance-heavy images were avoided whenever possible and losslessly compressed when unavoidable.

I was responsible for 90% of the front-end implementation and content-modeling.
